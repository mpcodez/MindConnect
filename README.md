Our app, called MindConnect, is designed to provide a comprehensive and convenient mental health support system. It serves as a platform for therapists and mental health specialists to connect with their patients and gather valuable data on their daily moods and activities.

Patients using our app can benefit from several key features, including a Mood Journal, which allows them to record their daily moods, thoughts, and activities in a journal format. They can also rate their mood on a scale, providing therapists with valuable data for assessment. The app offers visualizations and insights based on mood trends and activity data, enabling therapists to make more informed decisions. Patients can set achievable goals and track their progress over time, enhancing their mental health journey. Additionally, the app enables users to schedule and manage therapy appointments, receive reminders and notifications, and access guided meditations to combat mental episodes. The app also features a "Buddy Bot" mode, which is an AI system that offers support and companionship when therapists are unavailable.

To accurately address this problem, we've implemented various technical features. We use natural language processing to analyze patient responses and provide detailed insights to therapists for future patients. This aids in understanding each patient's unique needs and progress. Moreover, our app utilizes mood data, responses to journal prompts, and Buddy Bot messaging data to offer detailed insights into a patient's mental health outlook. It helps therapists assess whether their patients' mental health is improving or deteriorating and identifies areas needing more support. These insights are communicated to therapists through reports, enabling them to tailor their approach to each patient's specific needs.

Overall, our app is a significant step towards making mental health support more accessible and convenient for everyone.
